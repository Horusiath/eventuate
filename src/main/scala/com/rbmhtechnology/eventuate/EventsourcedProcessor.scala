/**
 * An [[EventsourcedWriter]] that writes processed events to a `targetEventLog`. `EventsourcedProcessor`
 * is an idempotent writer that guarantees that no duplicates are ever written to the target event log,
 * also under failure conditions. Hence, applications don't need to take extra care about idempotency.
 * Processed events are returned by `processEvent`, an application-defined event handler that is called
 * with events stored in the source `eventLog`.
 *
 * The `processEvent` event handler may also update actor state. When a processor (re)starts, its state is
 * automatically recovered by replaying events, optionally starting from a snapshot. Snapshots of processor
 * state can be saved with the `save` method in the processor's `onCommand` handler. An event-sourced processor
 * that doesn't need to maintain internal state (= stateless processor) should implement [[StatelessProcessor]]
 * instead.
 *
 * Usually, a processor's source event log is different from its target event log. If a processor needs to
 * write processed events back to its source event log, it must reserve its own entry in the vector clock by
 * setting `sharedClockEntry` to `false`.
 *
 * During initialization, a processor reads the processing progress from the target event log. The timeout
 * for this read operation can be configured with the `eventuate.processor.read-timeout` parameter for all
 * event-sourced processors or defined on a per class or instance basis by overriding `readTimeout`. The timeout
 * for write operations to the target log can be configured with the `eventuate.processor.write-timeout` parameter
 * for all event-sourced processors or defined on a per class or instance basis by overriding `writeTimeout`.
